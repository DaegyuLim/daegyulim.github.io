The robust balancing capability of humanoid robots has been considered as one of the crucial requirements for their mobility in real environments. In particular, many studies have been devoted to the efficient implementation of human-inspired ankle, hip, and stepping strategies, to endow humanoids with human-level balancing capability. In this paper, a robust balance control framework for humanoids is proposed. Firstly, a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework is proposed for Capture Point (CP) tracking control, enabling the integration of ankle, hip, and stepping strategies within a single framework. Additionally, a variable weighting method is introduced that adjusts the weighting parameters of the Centroidal Angular Momentum (CAM) damping control. Secondly, a hierarchical structure of the MPC and a stepping controller was proposed, allowing for the step time optimization. The robust balancing performance of the proposed method is validated through simulations and real robot experiments. Furthermore, a superior balancing performance is demonstrated compared to a state-of-the-art Quadratic Programming (QP)-based CP controller that employs the ankle, hip, and stepping strategies.
