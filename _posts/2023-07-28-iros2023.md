The estimation of external joint torque and contact
wrench is essential for achieving stable locomotion of
humanoids and safety-oriented robots. Although the contact
wrench on the foot of humanoids can be measured using
a force-torque sensor (FTS), FTS increases the cost, inertia,
complexity, and failure possibility of the system. This paper
introduces a method for learning external joint torque solely
using proprioceptive sensors (encoders and IMUs) for a floating
base robot. For learning, the GRU network is used and random
walking data is collected. Real robot experiments demonstrate
that the network can estimate the external torque and contact
wrench with significantly smaller errors compared to the
model-based method, momentum observer (MOB) with friction
modeling. The study also validates that the estimated contact
wrench can be utilized for zero moment point (ZMP) feedback
control, enabling stable walking. Moreover, even when the
robotâ€™s feet and the inertia of the upper body are changed, the
trained network shows consistent performance with a model based
calibration. This result demonstrates the possibility of
removing FTS on the robot, which reduces the disadvantages
of hardware sensors.
