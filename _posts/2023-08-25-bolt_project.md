## GOAL
The goal of this project is the development of an open-source bipedal platform to foster research and education on the bipedal walking algorithm.
This project is based on the existing open-source bipedal robot, BOLT, but we increase the degrees of freedom of BOLT from 6 to 10 resulting in BOLT-10.
